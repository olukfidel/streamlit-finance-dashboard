## üìä Data Source

This application is designed to work with a CSV file containing US state financial data. The default dataset used is `finance.csv`.

For the application to function correctly, your dataset must contain the following columns:

  * `State`: The name of the state (e.g., 'CALIFORNIA').
  * `Year`: The year of the data entry (e.g., 1994).
  * `Totals.Revenue`: Total revenue figures.
  * `Totals.Expenditure`: Total expenditure figures.
  * `Details.Health.Health Total Expenditure`: Total spending on health.
  * `Details.Education.Education Total`: Total spending on education.

You can upload your own dataset via the sidebar, as long as it adheres to this column structure.
